# snake-io
A snake.io like game made with C++ and the SFML library. Though intended for a university project but definitely an example of how easily these types of mini games can be made using C++ with its SFML library


Source Code:
1. The source code contains the source files but will not compiled normally. SFML environment required.
2. The font and image files will compile altogether withe source code into the game exe.

Game:
1. All the game files must be in the same directory
2. In the game, left snake is controlled with WASD and the right one with arrow keys.
3. Press and hole space(wasd) or num zero(arrow) to boost movement but will deduct 1 score per second.
4. **The game is will not run without certain versions of Dot Net frame work, visual c++ installed.**
